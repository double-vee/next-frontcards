# Frontcards

I started this project as a small **JavaScript** exercise and a means to unclutter my frontend notes (see the [initial repo](https://github.com/double-vee/js-frontcards)).

Eventually, it turned into a **Next.js** exploration endeavor and a frontend learning tool that might be useful to aspiring developers.

The app renders a set of rotating cards for each selected frontend category. Each card shows a bunch of notes and/or code snippets.

Categories, notes and snippets will be subsequently added to the database.

## Built with

- React v18
- Next.js v14
- CSS modules
- [Bright](https://bright.codehike.org) (React Server Component for syntax highlighting)
